This ensures that the function crosses zero at least once in the interval. If a valid initial interval is used then these algorithm cannot fail, provided the function is well-behaved. Note that a bracketing algorithm cannot find roots of even degree, since these do not cross the x-axis."],["RootFdfSolver","This is a workspace for finding roots using methods which do require derivatives."],["RootFdfSolverType","The root polishing algorithms described in this section require an initial guess for the location of the root. There is no absolute guarantee of convergence—the function must be suitable for this technique and the initial guess must be sufficiently close to the root for it to work. When these conditions are satisfied then convergence is quadratic. These algorithms make use of both the function and its derivative."]]});
